## Installation  

```  
Requiements:  
1. Python 3.5 or later version  
2. Packages:  
    numpy (>=1.15.1)  
    keras (2.3.1)  
    tensorflow(-gpu) (1.15.2)  
    hickle (>=3.4)
  
Package installation:
  
$ pip install -U numpy  
$ pip install keras == 2.3.1 
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.2 #pip install tensorflow==1.15.2  
$ pip install -U hickle  
$ git clone https://github.com/xy-chen16/DeepSilencer.git   
$ cd DeepSilencer    
```

## Data Preprocessing

### Load the genome files:
```  
$ cd data 
$ mkdir -p genome/mm10 && cd genome/mm10
$ nohup wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz
$ tar zvfx chromFa.tar.gz
$ cd ..
$ mkdir hg19 && cd hg19
$ nohup wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz
$ tar zvfx chromFa.tar.gz 
$ cd ../../..
```
### Unzip the open region files and result files:
```  
$ tar -xjvf data/open_region.tar.bz2 -C data
$ tar -xjvf result/result.tar.bz2 -C result
```
## Tutorial   
For demonstrating the classification performance of DeepSilencer, we uses the same data as the gapped k-mer SVM (gkmSVM), which is a complex array of distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) consisting of promoters, enhancers, insulators and silencers (Jayavelu et al., 2019). We chose the top 2000 uncharacterized CREs sequences with the lowest MPRA activity as a positive set, and the bottom 2000 uncharacterized CREs with highest MPRA activity as a negative set.  
### self-projection  
For the self-projection experiment, we randomly selected 80% of the data as trainning set and used the remaining 20% of data as test set.
```   
$ python code/run_self_projection.py
```
The performance of DeepSilencer was shown in the following Figure.

We also compared our method with gkmSVM using the same datasets by generating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by plotting true positive rate versus false positive rate and the precision recall curve (PRC). The performance of two methods was shown in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>ROC</th>
    <th>PRC</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>DeepSilencer</th>
    <th><td bgcolor=#FF00FF>0.827</td></th>
    <th>0.842</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>gkmSVM</th>
    <th>0.81</th>
    <th>0.76</th>
</tr>
</table>

### crossdataset-projection 
In order to find the candidate silencer elements in homo sapiens and mus musculus, we trained the DeepSilencer model based on the whole sequences using in the self-projection experiments. First, we trained the model: 

```   
$ python code/train_for_crossdata_projection.py
```
Predict the candidate silencer elements in homo sapiens (hg19): 
```   
$ python code/run_crossdata_projection_human.py
```
Predict the candidate silencer elements in mus musculus (mm10): 
```
$ python code/run_crossdata_projection_mouse.py
```
Then you can check the results in the *results* folder.
